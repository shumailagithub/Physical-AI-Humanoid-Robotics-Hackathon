# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** textbook! This course bridges the gap between the digital brain and the physical body, teaching you to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions.

## Course Overview

The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the physical world. This course introduces **Physical AI**—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws. You'll learn to work with ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac to create intelligent robotic systems.

## What You'll Learn

- 🤖 **Physical AI Principles** - Understand embodied intelligence
- 🔧 **ROS 2 Mastery** - Control robots with the Robot Operating System
- 🎮 **Simulation** - Build digital twins with Gazebo and Unity
- 🧠 **NVIDIA Isaac** - Leverage AI-powered perception
- 🗣️ **Conversational Robotics** - Integrate GPT models for natural interaction

## Course Modules

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
Learn the middleware that connects all robot components. Master nodes, topics, services, and URDF.

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
Simulate physics, gravity, and collisions. Build virtual environments for testing.

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)
Explore photorealistic simulation, VSLAM, and GPU-accelerated perception.

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
Combine LLMs with robotics for voice-controlled autonomous systems.

## Prerequisites

- Python programming experience
- Basic understanding of AI/ML concepts
- Familiarity with Linux command line

## Getting Started

Start with [Introduction to Physical AI](/docs/module1/week1-intro-physical-ai) to begin your journey into the world of embodied intelligence.

## Why Physical AI Matters

Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they share our physical form and can be trained with abundant data from interacting in human environments. This represents a significant transition from AI models confined to digital environments to **embodied intelligence** that operates in physical space.
