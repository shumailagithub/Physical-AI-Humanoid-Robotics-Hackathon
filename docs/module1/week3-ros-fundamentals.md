# Week 3: ROS 2 Architecture

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
- Explain the ROS 2 architecture and its role in robotics
- Understand the DDS (Data Distribution Service) middleware
- Create and run ROS 2 nodes using Python (rclpy)
- Implement publishers and subscribers for robot communication
- Use ROS 2 command-line tools for debugging

## The Physics (Why)

A humanoid robot is not a single program—it's a complex system of interconnected components:
- **Sensors** producing data at different rates
- **Controllers** running at high frequencies for stability
- **Planners** computing trajectories
- **Safety monitors** watching for dangerous conditions

These components must communicate reliably, in real-time, and often across multiple computers. **ROS 2** (Robot Operating System 2) provides the middleware that makes this possible.

Without ROS 2, you would need to:
- Write custom networking code for every component
- Handle message serialization manually
- Implement your own discovery mechanisms
- Build debugging and visualization tools from scratch

ROS 2 solves these problems with a standardized, battle-tested framework.

## The Analogy (Mental Model)

Think of ROS 2 like a **postal system** for robots:

- **Nodes** are like offices that send and receive mail
- **Topics** are like mailing addresses—anyone can send to or receive from an address
- **Messages** are like letters with standardized formats
- **Services** are like registered mail—you send a request and wait for a response
- **Actions** are like package tracking—long-running tasks with progress updates

The **DDS middleware** is like the postal infrastructure—it handles routing, delivery, and ensures messages arrive reliably.

### ROS 2 Command-Line Tools

```bash
# List all running nodes
ros2 node list

# Get info about a specific node
ros2 node info /sensor_publisher

# List all topics
ros2 topic list

# Show topic message type
ros2 topic info /cmd_vel

# Echo messages on a topic (great for debugging)
ros2 topic echo /sensor/temperature

# Publish a test message
ros2 topic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist \
  "{linear: {x: 0.5}, angular: {z: 0.1}}"

# Check publishing rate
ros2 topic hz /sensor/temperature
```

## The Hardware Reality (Warning)

:::warning Network Configuration
ROS 2 uses DDS for communication, which relies on multicast networking. Common issues:
- **Firewall blocking**: Disable firewall or add ROS 2 exceptions
- **Multiple network interfaces**: Set `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` to isolate traffic
- **Wi-Fi latency**: Use wired Ethernet for real-time control
:::

### Quality of Service (QoS) Settings

QoS determines how messages are delivered:

```python
from rclpy.qos import QoSProfile, ReliabilityPolicy, HistoryPolicy

# For sensor data: best effort, keep latest
sensor_qos = QoSProfile(
    reliability=ReliabilityPolicy.BEST_EFFORT,
    history=HistoryPolicy.KEEP_LAST,
    depth=1
)

# For commands: reliable delivery
command_qos = QoSProfile(
    reliability=ReliabilityPolicy.RELIABLE,
    history=HistoryPolicy.KEEP_LAST,
    depth=10
)
```

:::danger Real-Time Constraints
ROS 2 nodes run in user space and are not real-time by default. For safety-critical control:
- Use `ros2_control` with real-time controllers
- Consider running on a real-time Linux kernel (PREEMPT_RT)
- Keep control loops in dedicated high-priority threads
:::

## Assessment

### Recall

1. What is the role of DDS in ROS 2?
2. What is the difference between a topic and a service?
3. How do you create a timer in a ROS 2 node?
4. What command shows all active topics?

### Apply

1. Create a ROS 2 node that:
   - Subscribes to `/imu` (sensor_msgs/Imu)
   - Calculates the robot's tilt angle
   - Publishes a warning to `/safety/tilt_warning` if tilt > 15°

2. Write a launch file that starts both a publisher and subscriber node with configurable parameters.

3. Implement a node that logs all messages on `/cmd_vel` to a CSV file for later analysis.

### Analyze

1. Why might you choose `BEST_EFFORT` QoS for camera images but `RELIABLE` for emergency stop commands?

2. A robot has 10 sensor nodes each publishing at 100 Hz. Calculate the total message throughput and discuss potential bottlenecks.

3. Compare the trade-offs between using topics vs. services for robot arm position commands.
